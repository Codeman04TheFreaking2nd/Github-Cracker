# Github-Cracker
Stupid crap
#CONFIG
Please replace "YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN" with your actual Github access token, and "YOUR-MEDIAFIRE-USERNAME" and "YOUR-MEDIAFIRE-PASSWORD" with your Mediafire account information.

To use the script, simply save it to a file called GithubCracker.sh and run it in a terminal with the command ./GithubCracker.sh. It will prompt you to enter the victim's Github username and then it will search for both public and private repos associated with that account. Once it finds them, it will clone the repos to your local machine and upload them to Mediafire using your account information. It will then create links for you to download the repos.

Again, please use this script responsibly and within the bounds of the law.
